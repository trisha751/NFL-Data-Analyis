# NFL Data Analyis

## What is NFL?
The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major North American professional sports leagues, the highest professional level of American football in the world.

The NFL consists of 32 clubs divided into two conferences of 16 teams in each. Each conference is divided into four divisions of four clubs in each. The 32 teams are organized into eight geographic divisions of four teams each. These divisions are further organized into two conferences, the National Football Conference and the American Football Conference.

The NFL season format consists of a three-week preseason, an eighteen-week regular season (each team plays 17 games), and a fourteen-team single-elimination playoff culminating in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game.

## Sports Analytics
Sports analytics are a collection of relevant, historical, statistics that can provide a competitive advantage to a team or individual. Through the collection and analyzation of these data, sports analytics inform players, coaches and other staff in order to facilitate decision making both during and prior to sporting events. Making sense of sports performance data can be a challenging task but is nevertheless an essential part of performance analysis investigations.

It’s not only football that is being transformed by data’s mounting capabilities; technology is revolutionising sports across the board, from tennis to motor racing, to cycling. Collecting and analysing data onsite during an event allows for tactics to be decided in real time, but also offers the opportunity for data to be used for long term research and development of sports. Data is becoming recognized as one of the most important assets for innovation today, especially in sports, where benefits are reaped by both sportsmen and viewers alike.
